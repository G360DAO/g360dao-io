# Notes

- Discussed goals and personas(community (developers, security engineers) building, attract investors)
- Discussed menu and flow, we have one pagers and separate pages mixed. 
- Menu and breadcrumb consumes a lot of space, 
- Discord, Github links etc should be more visible because our community lives there
- Onboarding could be a separate menu
- Contact US could be replaced by Join Us, linking to the onboarding guide
- Change  "Learn more" to Join us as well?
- We choose to modify the website instead of building something new, because the setup is ok and we have limited time
- Martin will be looking at the styling: font can be smaller, precompiling

## Menu suggestion

- Logo (links to homepage)
- Whitepaper
- Community
- Investors
- Information Security Insights (or Product)
- Join Us (link to onboarding guide)

## Footer menu suggestion
- Community
  - Manifesto
  - Code of conduct
  - Governance
  - Onboarding Guide
- Investors
  - NFT
  - Investment token
- Information Security Insights (or Product)
  - Backlog
  - Legal
  - Licensing

Maybe the main menu should be the same as the footer menu, some submenu items need more attention
Also, we might want a separate menu for each persona

@Zeichnicht will come up with some wireframe suggestions
